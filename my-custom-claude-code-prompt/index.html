                <p>Hi everyone! Today I want to share my custom prompt for Claude Code that makes it work exactly how I need it to work.</p>

<p>Last month I've been using Claude Code for coding. It's a great tool, but default behavior was driving me crazy. Claude was too verbose, added unnecessary explanations, and sometimes made changes without being sure about them. So I decided to create a custom prompt that fixes all these problems.</p>

<h2>What was the problem?</h2>

When you use Claude Code by default, you might notice that it:
<ul>
<li>Adds phrases like "Here's what I found..." before every answer</li>
<li>Explains code after making changes even when you didn't ask</li>
<li>Makes assumptions without asking for clarification</li>
<li>Sometimes guesses instead of checking documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, this was wasting time. I just want Claude to do what I ask, without all the extra talking.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

Claude Code supports custom prompts through <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file. You can create it in <code>~/.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> for global settings or in your project's <code>.claude/</code> directory.

I created a prompt that fixes all my problems:

<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Global Claude Instructions

## Communication Style Preferences

### Tone and Directness
- Be direct and to the point
- No unnecessary preamble or explanations unless asked
- Answer questions concisely
- Don't add phrases like "Here's what I found..." or "Let me explain..."
- If I ask you to do something, just do it without narrating

### Making Changes
- Don't make assumptions - ask for clarification when uncertain
- Research and verify before making changes (use documentation when needed)
- Be 100% confident in your changes
- If you're not sure, say so explicitly
- Think carefully before acting
- Double-checks any links you suggest

### Error Handling
- When something fails, provide clear error messages
- Don't hide failures or errors
- Explain what went wrong and why

### Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow existing code patterns in the repository
- Don't over-engineer solutions
- Prefer simple, clear implementations over clever ones

### Validation
- Verify assumptions before implementing
- Test logic before suggesting it
- Use external documentation when available
- Double-check syntax and parameters

### General
- Don't repeat yourself
- Focus on what I asked for
- Don't add extra features unless requested
- Keep responses short and relevant

<h2>What changed?</h2>

After adding this prompt, Claude Code became much better:

<p><strong>Before:</strong> "I'll help you fix this issue. Let me first read the file to understand the current implementation. After analyzing the code, I can see that the problem is... Here's what I'm going to do..."</p>

<p><strong>After:</strong> [Just fixes the issue]</p>

<p>It's simple. When I ask "what is 2+2?", I get "4", not "Let me calculate this for you. The answer to your mathematical question is 4. I hope this helps!"</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

Just create <code>~/.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> file and paste the prompt from above. That's all. Claude Code will use these instructions for all your projects.

If you want project-specific settings, create <code>.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> in your project directory.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

That's all. I'll be happy, If this prompt helps you make Claude Code work better for you.
